Uchechukwu is the team lead of this group and was assigned with the responsibility of 
creating the Landing page as well as the styling and responsiveness.

Pipeoluwa, Simi and Glory were assigned to handle the Search pages as follows:

Pipeoluwa: Created the Search page which involves the creating the Camp camps and 
making sure the Search button was functional with the use of JavaScript

This is a group assignent and as such should involve the collaboration of at least 3 developers.

Flow: The first page your user should see is the landing page. From the landing page, I should get to the search page and then when I click on an item in the search page, I should be taken to the individual campground page.

All designs for the screens are in the designs folder and the images or icons needed are in the assets folder.

Note:
- Your page must be responsive. Using tailwind would give you a higher score. Based on the design images, we have 3 separate views for 3 screen sizes.

- Your campground data must not be hardcoded!
hint: Create an array of campgrounds, map through it and render it on your page.


Key functionalities:
- I should be able to search through your campgrounds and it has to function.
- When i click on a campground card, it should take me to the individual campground page and show me details of the capground that I selected.


How to implement:
- Build the structure of the pages first
- Implement responsiveness
- Implement the necessary functionalities.
